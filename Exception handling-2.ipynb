    "When creating a custom exception class in Python, it's recommended to inherit from the base Exception class. Here's why:\n",
    "Standard Exception Behavior: By inheriting from Exception, your custom exception class will behave like a standard Python exception. \n",
    "This means it will have access to the same attributes and methods as built-in exceptions.\n",
    "Error Handling: When you inherit from Exception, your custom exception will be caught by except Exception blocks, \n",
    "which is a common way to catch and handle exceptions in Python.\n",
    "Consistency: Inheriting from Exception ensures consistency with Python's built-in exception hierarchy. \n",
    "This makes your code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "Access to Exception Methods: By inheriting from Exception, your custom exception class will have access to methods like __str__ and __repr__, \n",
    "which are used to provide a string representation of the exception.'''\n"
